                state governments and treasuries within the United States.</p>
             <p >The purpose of unclaimed property laws is to protect the public by ensuring money and

            Often these funds are held for only a brief period of time, after which the agency 
    responsible for them may be permitted to seize them through a process called 
    “escheatment”, which originated in feudal 16th century England. <b>
        We think private
