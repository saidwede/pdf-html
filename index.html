        <h4>Did you know that over $4 BILLION DOLLARS in unclaimed funds is just 
            sitting in government bank accounts?</h4>
         <p class="text-center">And did you know that if the people who those funds belong to don’t <b>don’t know about it</b> and 
            don’t claim them, <b>the government gets to keep them</b>? Approximately 1 in 10 people have 
            unclaimed property  There are literally billions of dollars in unclaimed property, held by 
            state governments and treasuries within the United States.</p>
         <p class="text-center">The purpose of unclaimed property laws is to protect the public by ensuring money and 
            property owed to them is returned, rather than remaining permanently with financial 
            institutions, business associations, governments, and other entities.</p>
         <p class="text-center">Pursuant to jurisdictional regulations our organization mails letters and reaches out by 
            phone to property owners informing them of property in their name held by the 
            government agency. <b>We are successful in reuniting owners with their unclaimed 
                property.</b> </p>

            their public records in search of lost, missing, and unclaimed funds belonging to private

            Often these funds are held for only a brief period of time, after which the agency 
    responsible for them may be permitted to seize them through a process called 
    “escheatment”, which originated in feudal 16th century England. <b>
        We think private 
    citizens losing their funds to faceless government agencies is completely unfair and 
    we are determined to prevent this from happening to anyone, especially you.
