        citizens like yourself.

            </h6>
            <p class="text-center">
                The government agencies we audit typically DO NOT post these unclaimed funds
accounts online. You are welcome to search state unclaimed funds websites, but if you
find funds there, these are not the funds we're informing you about.

                Why Should I use Your Company?
            </h6>
            <p class="text-center">
                Most of the assets we locate aren't available by searching the internet, and it's unlikely
that without the aid of a company like ours, that you'll be notified of their existence by
the agency holding them.
