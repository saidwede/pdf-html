        Refund Advocates LLC audits government agencies nationwide to locate money owed to
private individuals, Families and companies. <b>The government makes no attempt</b> (nor are they obligated) to notify citizens that they are owed money from any kind of
abandonment, other than publishing the list in a newspaper or sending a letter to
whatever old address the Agency has on file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The types of funds these falls under are NOT on government lists that they publish; they
are hidden deep in government records and 99% of all citizens do not even know that
they exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        If these funds go unclaimed for too long, they are usually lost to the government agency
that is holding them.
    </p>
    
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">The Search</h5>

        <img src="img/image7.jpg" srcset="">
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we’ve located the funds, <b>great efforts</b> are expended to then locate the rightful
owner(s). Our team goes to work with our attorneys, researchers and notaries to work
with the agency holding your unclaimed money.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, if these funds go unclaimed for too long, they are usually lost to the
government agency holding them.

        Once you have spoken to one of our Refund Specialists and verbally agreed to let us
work your claim, we will set up a time for you to sign several pages of paperwork to
allow us to get started.
    </p>

     <p>
        Our firm works on a contingent basis – this means that there are no up-front or out-
of-pocket expenses to you, EVER. We’re paid ONLY upon successful collection of your
claim. We do ALL the work, pay ALL the expenses, and jump through ALL the
administrative hoops to claim your money – and if the claim is un-successful you owe us
nothing. We take all the risk in exchange for an agreed upon percentage of the collected
funds – <br>
a fair trade!
    </p>
    <p>
        We will send a local notary public with your paperwork package, once notarized we start
processing claims immediately and follow through until the end, making sure to keep
you updated all along the way.
